# iPod Menu Clone using React.js

This project is a replica of the classic iPod interface, built using React.js, featuring an interactive circular menu for navigation.

## Features

- **Main Menu**: Includes options like "Settings", "Games", "Music", and "Coverflow". The menu displays these options on a scrollable interface.
  
- **Circular Navigation Wheel**: Implemented the iconic iPod click-wheel interaction. Users can click and hold on the circular wheel and drag it in a circular motion to scroll through the menu options. The currently selected option is highlighted with an "active" class.

- **Menu Navigation**:
  - Clicking the "OK" button opens the selected itemâ€™s screen (e.g., Settings, Games, Music).
  - Clicking the "Menu" button returns to the main menu from any submenu or screen.

- **Submenus**: Under the "Music" option, there are submenus like "All Songs", "Artists", etc. Similar navigation applies here.

- **First Item Selected**: By default, the first item selected on the side menu is "Coverflow" when the app starts.

## Key Components

- **SideMenu Component**: The main menu that displays various options and handles the navigation logic.
